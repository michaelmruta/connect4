== Connect 4

written in Ruby on Rails by Mekâ€¦

It took me a whole day to write this,
i thought it was small and would be fast but I was wrong
Maybe because I'm just a beginner in rails or Critical in many parts.

To run the app:
of course set it up on rails
set up the db too,

open in two different browser or computer
because it uses session params

there maybe a lot of bugs, I don't know, i didn't test..

the code is not clean,
i write it while designing the algorithm
